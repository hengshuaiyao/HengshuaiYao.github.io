## About me:

Since 2017, I am working on reinforcement learning and deep learning for autonomous driving. We're hiring full-time and intern positions for reinforcement learning and robotics. 

In 2016, I was building an AI game player and a character AI module for NCSoft (California).  

In 2014, I was working on a mobile app startup (6 team members) in Edmonton during and after my PhD studies.  

From 2008 to 2014, I was studying my Ph.D at University of Alberta, working on Reinforcement Learning, Reinforcement Ranking and Web Search.

## Robocup Soccer 

a game of our team. The player was based on hierachical reinforcement learning. Decisions the player has to make include: dribbling, passing, running, shooting, goal keeping, positioning (team position), resting, defending, etc. A high-level policy learns how to select a decision, and a low-level controller executes the selected decision. Both the high-level and low-level contoller were learned using reinforcement learning.

## Tetris
Using a policy iteration algorithm to play a tetris game. In this game, only considering the "S" and "Z" shapes (harder than the original game). The player was trained with data of randomly playing the game.

## Openprice
The mobile App is the product of our startup Openprice. The app helps users manage their receipts and manage shopping.
