## Welcome!

Hi, My name is Hengshuai Yao. Current I am working at Huawei Canada leading a team of 13 developing RL and DL robotics. Before that, I was building an AI system for NCSoft in California. When doing my Ph.D at University of Alberta (2008--2014), I was working with Csaba Szepesvari, Rich Sutton, Dale Schuurmans, Davood Rafiei, Shalabh Bhatnagar and Chihoon Lee.

## Research

### Action-model based RL

- Approximate Policy Iteration with Linear Action Models. 
- Pseudo-MDPs. 
- Multi-step linear Dyna style planning. 

### Temporal Difference Learning

- Preconditioned TD learning. 
- Two-time scale update. 

### Web Search
- Reinforcement learning for ranking. 
- Learning to discover trending topics.
