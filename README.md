## Welcome to Hengshuai's homepage

Hi, My name is Hengshuai Yao. I am interested in reinforcement learning and deep learning based robotics. When doing my Ph.D at University of Alberta, I was working with Csaba Szepesvari and Rich Sutton on model-based reinforcement learning. Current I am working at Huawei Canada leading a team of 13 developing RL and DL robotics. Before that, I was building an AI system for NCSoft in California.
