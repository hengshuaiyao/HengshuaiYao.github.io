## Hello, world!
My name is Hengshuai Yao. I studied reinforcement learning at Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence (RLAI) lab from 2008 to 2015 in a Ph.D program at Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta. My thesis is on model-based reinforcement learning with linear function approximation. During my Ph.D studies, I worked with Dr. Csaba Szepesvari, Dr. Rich Sutton, Dr. Dale Schuurmans, and Dr. Davood Rafiei on reinforcement learning theory, algorithms and web applications. I joined NCSoft game studio in San Francisco in 2016 working on  reinforcement learning in games. I moved back to Canada in 2017 and joined Huawei. 

### RL Lab:
Our Lab is focused on reinforcement learning for practical problems, from large state-action space problems to safety robot machines; as well as fundamental algorithm research.

## Robocup Soccer 
I was a member of TsinghuAeolus (soccer simulation team at Tsinghua University) for World Cup Simulation League. 
Here shows a game of our team TsinghuAeolus playing against Everest in the final match at Robocup 2003. Our TsinghuAeolus was based on hierarchical reinforcement learning. Decisions the player has to make include: dribbling, passing, running, shooting, goal keeping, positioning (team position), resting, defending, etc. A high-level policy learns how to select a decision, and a low-level controller executes the selected decision. Both the high-level and low-level controller were learned using reinforcement learning.

## Tetris
I developed a policy iteration algorithm to play a Tetris game. In this game, there are only hard shapes: "S" and "Z". The player was trained with data of randomly playing the game.

## Openprice
The mobile App is the product of our startup Openprice which I cofounded in 2016. The app helps users manage their receipts and manage shopping.  

Uploading receipts and have it OCR-ed:
