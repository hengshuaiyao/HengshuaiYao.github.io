## Hello, world!
My name is Hengshuai Yao. I studied reinforcement learning at Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence (RLAI) lab from 2008 to 2015 in a Ph.D program at Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta. My thesis is on model-based reinforcement learning with linear function approximation. During my Ph.D studies, I worked with Dr. Csaba Szepesvari, Dr. Rich Sutton, Dr. Dale Schuurmans, and Dr. Davood Rafiei on reinforcement learning theory, algorithms and web applications. I joined NCSoft game studio in San Francisco in 2016 working on  reinforcement learning in games. I moved back to Canada in 2017 and joined Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. 

### RLAD Lab:
I lead the "Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving (RLAD)" in Edmonton for Huawei Technologies. 
Our Lab aims to investigate fundamental issues in mobile robots, study the potential and risks of using Reinforcement Learning for wheel robots.

## Robocup Soccer 
I was a member of TsinghuAeolus (soccer simulation team at Tsinghua University) for World Cup Simulation League. 
Here shows a game of our team TsinghuAeolus playing against Everest in the final match at Robocup 2003. Our TsinghuAeolus was based on hierarchical reinforcement learning. Decisions the player has to make include: dribbling, passing, running, shooting, goal keeping, positioning (team position), resting, defending, etc. A high-level policy learns how to select a decision, and a low-level controller executes the selected decision. Both the high-level and low-level controller were learned using reinforcement learning.

## Tetris
I developed a policy iteration algorithm to play a Tetris game. In this game, there are only hard shapes: "S" and "Z". The player was trained with data of randomly playing the game.

## Openprice
The mobile App is the product of our startup Openprice which I cofounded in 2016. The app helps users manage their receipts and manage shopping.  

Uploading receipts and have it OCR-ed:

Backend server extract structured data, send it back and display on user's phone:
